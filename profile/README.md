# 📚 **ScratchMind — Deep Learning Re-Engineered from First Principles**

**ScratchMind** is a collection of open-source deep learning projects focused on **rebuilding modern AI from scratch** using **PyTorch**, following the historical evolution of ideas across vision, generative modeling, optimization, reinforcement learning, and more.

Every component is implemented manually — no shortcuts, no hidden abstractions — making ScratchMind a complete ecosystem for mastering deep learning through **first-principles engineering**.

---

## 🎯 **Mission**

> **To make artificial intelligence transparent, intuitive, and deeply learnable — by rebuilding every foundational idea from the ground up.**

ScratchMind is built on the belief that true mastery comes from **implementation**, not from using pre-built libraries.
All models, optimizers, and training techniques are implemented from the mathematical foundations upward.

---

## 🧠 **Philosophy**

### **1. Build, Not Borrow**

Everything is implemented from scratch.
No “import model,” no shortcuts.

>**NOTE:** Even though right now there will be external dependencies to *PyTorch* and *Scikit-Learn*, Eventual **GOAL** is to be self-sustaining ecosystem.

### **2. Evolution Over Recipes**

Each repo follows the chronological development of its domain.

### **3. Code That Teaches**

Readable > clever.
Minimal > magical.
Educational > compressed.

### **4. Modular Yet Unified**

Each Scratch project stands alone, but all follow the same structure, format, and documentation style.

## 🚀 **Goals of ScratchMind**

* Build intuition through **raw implementation**
* Make modern ML concepts **transparent and reproducible**
* Translate research papers directly into code
* Provide clean, educational references for every major subfield
* Create a long-term ecosystem for “learning by re-building”

---

## 📘 **Timelines and Roadmaps**

Every repository maintains a detailed **TIMELINE.md** file.

You can explore them:

* **ScratchML** → `ScratchML/documentation/TIMELINE.md`
* **ScratchVision** → `ScratchVision/documentation/TIMELINE.md`
* **ScratchGen** → `ScratchGen/documentation/TIMELINE.md`
* **ScratchGrad** → `ScratchGrad/documentation/TIMELINE.md`

As new repositories are added, their TIMELINE.md will appear here as well.
